Crispy Seltzer Waffles
======================

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- <span class="strike">2</span> <span class="update">3</span> tablespoons sugar
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- Slightly rounded ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ stick (4 tablespoons) unsalted butter, melted and and cooled and 2 large eggs
- <span class="update">½ teaspoon vanilla extract</span>
- 1¾ cups seltzer or club soda (from a new bottle)
- Vegetable oil for brushing waffle iron

_Accompaniments:_ butter; pure maple syrup
_Special Equipment:_ a well-seasoned or nonstick Belgian waffle iron or a standard waffle iron

Preheat waffle iron.  Put a rack in the middle of oven and put a large cooling rack on it.  Preheat oven to 200°F.

Whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl.  Add butter, eggs, seltzer, <span class="update">and vanilla</span> and whisk until smooth.

Brush waffle iron lightly with oil.  Spoon batter into iron, using ⅓ cup batter for each 4-inch Belgian waffle, and cook according to manufacturer's instructions.  Transfer waffles to rack in oven to keep warm; keep waffles in one layer, uncovered, so they stay crisp.  Make more waffles in same manner.

Serve with butter and maple syrup.
