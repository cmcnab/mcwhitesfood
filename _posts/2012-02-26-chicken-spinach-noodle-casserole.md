Chicken, Spinach, and Noodle Casserole
======================================

<span class="source">Real Simple</span>

- 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour
- 4 cups whole milk
- 1 cup sour cream  
- Kosher salt and black pepper
- 12 ounces egg noodles
- 4 slices sandwich bread <span class="update">(or panko bread crumbs)</span>
- 2 cups shredded cooked chicken or rotisserie chicken (also good with sausage)
- 5 ounces baby spinach, chopped <span class="update">(don't need to chop)</span>
- <span class="strike">2</span> <span class="update">1</span> teaspoon dried thyme
- <span class="update">1 cup sliced mushrooms</span>
- <span class="update">1 cup Gruyère to sprinkle on top</span>

Heat oven to 400° F.  Melt 4 tablespoons of the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat.  Add the flour and cook, stirring, until foamy, 1 to 2 minutes (do not let the mixture darken).  Slowly whisk in the milk.  Bring to a simmer and cook, whisking often, until thickened, 3 to 5 minutes.  Remove from heat and whisk in the sour cream, 1 teaspoon salt, and ¼ teaspoon pepper.

Meanwhile, cook the noodles according to the package directions; drain and return them to the pot.  Pulse the bread in a food processor until coarse crumbs form.  Melt the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter in a microwave-safe bowl.

Sauté or steam mushrooms until cooked.

Add the milk mixture, chicken, spinach, mushrooms, and thyme to the noodles and toss to combine.  Transfer to a 9-by-13-inch or some other 3-quart baking dish, sprinkle with Gruyère, then bread crumbs, and drizzle with the melted butter.

Bake until the bread crumbs are golden and the filling is bubbling, 8 to 10 minutes.  Let cool for 5 minutes before serving.
