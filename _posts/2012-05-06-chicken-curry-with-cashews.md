Chicken Curry with Cashews
==========================

<span class="update">Double recipe.</span>

- ½ stick (4 tablespoons) unsalted butter
- 2 mediums onions, finely chopped
- 2 large garlic cloves, finely chopped
- 1 tablespoon finely chopped peeled fresh ginger
- 3 tablespoons curry powder
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- ½ teaspoon cayenne
- 1 (3½- to 4-pound) chicken, rinsed, patted dry, and cut into 10 serving pieces
- 1 (14- to 15-ounce) can diced tomatoes in juice
- ¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro
- ¾ cup cashews (toasted or raw)
- ⅔ cup whole-milk 2% yogurt

_Garnish:_ chopped fresh cilantro  
_Accompaniment:_ basmati or jasmine rice

Heat butter in a 5- to 6-quart wide heavy pot over moderately low heat until foam subsides.  Add onions, garlic, and ginger and cook, stirring, until softened, about 5 minutes.  Add curry powder, salt, cumin, and cayenne and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes.  Add chicken and cook, stirring to coat, for 3 minutes.

Add tomatoes with juice and cilantro and bring to a simmer, then cover and simmer gently, stirring occasionally, until chicken is cooked through, about 40 minutes.

Just before serving, pulse cashews in a food processor or electric coffee/spice grinder until very finely ground (do not grind to a paste).  Add to curry, along with yogurt, and simmer gently, uncovered, stirring, until sauce is thickened, about 5 minutes.

Serve chicken over rice, sprinkled with cilantro.
