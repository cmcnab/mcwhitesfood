Turkey Cutlets with Mustard Wine Sauce
======================================

<span class="source">Gourmet Today</span>

- 4 (¼-inch-thick) turkey cutlets, rinsed and patted dry
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- ½ stick (4 tablespoons) unsalted butter
- ½ cup finely chopped shallots
- ½ cup dry white wine
- 1 tablespoon tarragon vinegar
- 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
- 2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh tarragon

Sprinkle cutlets with salt and pepper and, if necessary, pound them between sheets of plastic wrap with flat side of a meat pounder or with a rolling pin until ¼ inch thick.  Heat 1 tablespoon of butter in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until foam subsides.  Add 2 cutlets and cook, turning once, until golden and just cooked through, about 3 minutes.  Transfer with tongs to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm.  Add 1 tablespoon of butter to skillet and cook remaining 2 cutlets in same manner; transfer to platter.

Add 1 tablespoon butter to skillet and heat over moderately high heat until foam subsides.  Add shallots and cook, stirring, until golden, about 5 minutes.  Stir in any juices that have accumulated on turkey platter, then add wine, vinegar, and mustard and cook, whisking and scraping up brown bits, until sauce is slightly thickened, about 2 minutes.  Remove from heat and whisk in tarragon and remaining tablespoon butter.

Pour sauce over turkey cutlets.
