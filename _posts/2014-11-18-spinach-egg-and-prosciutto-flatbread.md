Spinach, Egg, and Prosciutto Flatbread
======================================

<span class="source">Cooking Light</span>

- 4 (2 oz) rectangular multigrain flatbreads
- 1 tablespoon olive oil, divided
- 1 cup finely chopped sweet onion
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper
- 10 cups baby spinach (about 12 oz)
- 4 large eggs
- 3 oz shredded part-skim mozzarella chesse (about ¾ cup)
- 2 (½ oz) slices prosciutto, chopped
- ¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

Preheat broiler to high.

Place flatbreads on a baking sheet lightly coated with olive oil.  Broil 1 minute.  Remove pan from oven; turn breads over.  Lightly coat with oil.  Broil 1 minute.

Heat a large skillet over medium heat.  Add 1 teaspoon oil to pan.  Add onion, salt, and red pepper; cook 3 minutes.  Add spinach; cook 1 minute.  Remove mixture from pan; keep warm.

Wipe pan clean with a paper towel.  Heat pan over medium heat.  Add remaining 2 teaspoons oil to pan; swirl to coat.  Crack eggs into pan; cook 1 minute on each side or until desired degree of doneness.

Divide spinach mixture evenly among flatbreads.  Top evenly with cheese and chopped prosciutto.  Broil 1 minute or until cheese melts.  Top each flatbread with 1 egg; sprinkle black pepper over eggs.  Serve immediately.
